      <strong>Insurance for HOSTS </strong>can be a wise investment: airCASITA
      advises HOSTS to minimize their rental-associated liability by such
      measures as posting and enforcing proper HOUSE RULES. Hosts can also post
      a graphical QUICK SUMMARY of House Rules as a reminder to Guests (See
      section on GRAPHICAL HOUSE RULES). By enforcing properly written House
      Rules, the potential for liability of the Host can potentially be reduced.
      airCASITA does not offer insurance to Hosts nor Guests. airCASITA does not
      accept responsibility for liability resulting from negligence of others.
      However, a claim can still be brought, such as when a Guest alleges
      injury, or alleges his property being stolen, while at a Host’s rental.
      For insurance against such liability claims, HOSTS might consider one of
      the following carriers: American Family, Obie, Farmer’s, Allstate, CBIZ,
      Proper, and Safely.
